# docker-security

This is a tool that can quickily list the outdated packages for docker images and containers.  This is still a work in progress and must be run on the same host as docker.  

Note, you must have the docker-py libraries installed to use. 

To get these libraries on fedora:

    $ pip install docker-py

To get these libraries on RHEL:

    $ yum install docker-python
